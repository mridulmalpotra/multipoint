multipoint
==========

Multipoint uses the XWindow interface and MPX library to create a standard Multiple Pointer program for Linux. It allows for multiple pointers to be allocated for every pointing device connected AFTER the program starts (i.e. all pointers connected before the program starts are considered as one).

Ciao! :D

Instructions:

1. Go to the directory containing the program files.

2. Run 'make'

3. Execute './Multipoint'

4. To close, simply press Ctrl+C. The program automatically joins all the extra pointers into one.

PS#1: For some mouses with multiple radio devices and transreceivers, there can be a possiblity of mutiple pointers for one device. Allow for the program to refresh for about 1 minute.

PS#2: There can be problems for distros running desktop management systems other than Xorg.

If you still get an error, feel free to notify me about the same.
